# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

The purpose of this project was to create a timed, multiple-choice  quiz that would keep track of the user's  score. The idea was to have the user select start quiz and trigger the timer function. As each question got answered, the application would retain correct vs incorrect answers and provide a score at the end. The score will be delivered and recorded once the user submits a name. Depending on the score, it will give a message to the user.
